					By starting donations at two cents a day, we hope that the act of giving becomes accessible to millions of ordinary people.  By capitalizing on the strength in numbers, we believe we can transform everyone's pocket change to make a difference around the world.

					Give your two cents, spread the word, and help change the world.

		    		Two Cents was established in Berkeley, California by four recent UC Berkeley graduates. The idea started as a concept for the first annual CITRIS Mobile App Challenge, and since then has transformed into a simple and recurring donation platform. We love serving the communities closest to us; and today, weâ€™re striving to create and engineer Two Cents -- something that we believe will make a tangible and meaningful difference around the world.
