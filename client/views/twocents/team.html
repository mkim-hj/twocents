Maruchi is currently a web design team director of Berkeley's premier design club, Innovative Design. He also conducts research at UCSF's Microdevices Lab where he helps engineer embedded solutions to improve the clinical environment for patients, nurses, and doctors. Maruchi originally thought of Two Cents while donating his pocket change to a homeless man in a Seoul metro station, and thought small daily donations from everybody could help a lot of people. Since then he has formed a team of his close friends who all believe that crowdfunded pocket change donations can make a difference.
