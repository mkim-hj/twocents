				By starting donations at two cents a day, we hope that <br>
				giving becomes accessible to millions of ordinary people; and by <br>
				capitalizing on the strength in numbers, we believe that <br>
				everyone's pocket change can transform into social change <br>
				to make a difference around our world.
